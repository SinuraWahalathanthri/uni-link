## 🎯 Why Uni Link?  

Universities often rely on multiple scattered platforms (emails, notice boards, group chats in whatsapp) to share information. This makes it difficult for students to stay updated and for lecturers to efficiently manage consultations.  

**Uni Link solves this problem by:**  
-  Providing a **single, unified platform** for communication and collaboration.  
-  Helping students easily **book consultations/meetings** with lecturers.  
-  Allowing lecturers to manage **appointments, resources, and announcements**.  
-  Encouraging **student engagement** through events, communities, and peer discussions.  

The goal is to make university life **simpler, smarter, and more connected**.
